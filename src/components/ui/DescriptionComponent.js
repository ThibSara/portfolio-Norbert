      <h2>Antonin - Mechanical Engineering Student</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Antonin, an aspiring mechanical engineering student passionate about modeling and simulation.
        I'm on a journey to showcase my portfolio of intricate 3D models through this website, highlighting my skills
        and dedication to the world of mechanical design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student of engineering, I dive into the complexities of mechanical systems, applying theoretical knowledge
        to real-world applications. My expertise lies in creating detailed models that bridge the gap between theory and
        practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the world of engineering, I find joy in the great outdoors. Hiking through scenic landscapes and casting a
        line into serene waters while fishing are my favorite ways to unwind and find inspiration. Nature fuels my
        creativity, and I bring that fresh perspective into my modeling work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me on this exploration of design and creativity as we embark on a journey through the world of mechanical
        modeling. üõ†Ô∏è
