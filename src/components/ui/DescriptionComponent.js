      <h2>Antonin - Mechanical Engineering Student</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Antonin, an aspiring mechanical engineering student passionate about modeling and simulation.
        I'm showcasing my detailed 3D models on this website to demonstrate my skills and dedication to mechanical design.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a student of engineering, I dive into the complexities of mechanical systems, applying theoretical knowledge
        to real-world applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the world of engineering, I find joy in the great outdoors. Hiking and fishing are my favorite ways to unwind and find inspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join me on this exploration of design and creativity as we embark on a journey through the world of mechanical
        modeling. üõ†Ô∏è
